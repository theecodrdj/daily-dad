# Daily Dad Online

[Daily Dad](https://daily-dad.theecodrdj.online)

Website built by me, THEE COD*R DJ, for my kids as a way to interact with them daily even if we aren't together that day. Also a small amount of learning involved. The site is broken into 5 pages, the main landing page at index.html and then a "Dad" Joke section at /joke/index.html, then a On This Day section at /onthisday/index.html, then a Vocab of the Day section at /votd/index.html and lastly a Random Facts section at /facts/index.html

## index.html

Main landing page for the site. Written in HTML using the Bootstrap 5 framework and adding custom CSS as necessary and utilizing JavaScript with JQuery. This page is basically just a gateway to the main 4 interactive sections.

## Dad Joke

This page lands you on the Dad Joke of the Day section. Using the same HTML and Bootsrap 5 to build this page as well as custom CSS and JS/JQuery. It is simply two buttons. The first button reveals the joke setup, and the second the punchline. A 2nd click of either button will hide the content and change the button label.

## Vocab of the Day

This page lands you on the VotD section of Daily Dad. Built on all same framework and setup, but this section has a few extra buttons, as it reveals a word of the day, as well as its Spanish translation, and then the definition in English and Spanish.

## On This Day

This page will land you on the history section of the site. Same framework and template here. The first button reveals the headline of the historical happening, and the second button will reveal a more detailed recounting.

## Random Factoids

The last page lands you right in the random factoid section of Daily Dad. Same framework and template. The first button reveals the first random fact and the second button will reveal a 2nd random fact for the day.
